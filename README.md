## 🚀 About Me
As a Technical Support Manager at Spiro.AI, I contribute to delivering complex client integrations using tools like Tray.io, Zapier, and Ruby-based frameworks to improve data workflows across ERP, CRM, and marketing platforms. I played a key role in migrating to a centralized code-based integration framework, ensuring maintainable and scalable solutions, while leading the design, development, and deployment of 20 production integrations within a tight timeline. 

💡 My focus: turning technical execution into measurable business impact.
